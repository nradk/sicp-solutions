Above, instead of relying on our pre-defined predicates `sum?` and `product?`, the `deriv` function was changed to invoke the correct differentiation logic using the table-based dispatch that was described in the text. Assuming the table is correctly populated, upon calling the new `deriv`, a lookup is performed on the table to get the correct procedure to apply for the operation `deriv` and the given type of expression, which in our case (confusingly enough) is equivalent to the operator of the algebraic expression. The exception to this are of course inputs that are numbers or variables, because in our system we represent them as raw values (like `42` or `'z`) instead of as data with type tags.\n",

Show how such a strategy can be implemented with data-directed programming. As an example, suppose that each division’s personnel records consist of a single file, which contains a set of records keyed on employees’ names.
