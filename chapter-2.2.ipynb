This means, at each step, Louis' implementation is making `board-size` times more calls to `queen-cols` than required.\n",

However, I don't think this 'intuitive' solution is correct, as the actual ratio of the run-times are wildly different. I looked online for answers and there seem to be a lot of different answers by different people, some more confident, some less so."
