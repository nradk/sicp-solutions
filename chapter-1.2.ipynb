    "**There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables $a$ and $b$ in the `fib-iter` process of Section 1.2.2: $a \\leftarrow a+b$ and $b \\leftarrow a$. Call this transformation $T$, and observe that applying $T$ over and over again $n$ times, starting with $1$ and $0$, produces the pair $Fib(n + 1)$ and $Fib(n)$. In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying $T^n$, the $n^{th}$ power of the transformation $T$, starting with the pair $(1, 0)$. Now consider\n",
    "$T$ to be the special case of $p = 0$ and $q = 1$ in a family of transformations $T_{pq}$, where $T_{pq}$ transforms the pair $(a,b)$ according to $a \\leftarrow bq + aq + ap$ and $b \\leftarrow bp + aq$. Show that if we apply such a transformation $T_{pq}$ twice, the effect is the same as using a single transformation $T_{p'q'}$ of the same form, and compute $p'$ and $q'$ in terms of $p$ and $q$. This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we can compute $T^n$ using successive squaring, as in the `fast-expt` procedure. Put this all together to complete the following procedure, which runs in a logarithmic number of steps:**"

    "**The `smallest-divisor` procedure shown at the start of this section does lots of needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible by $2$ there is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers. This suggests that the values used for `test-divisor` should not be $2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\\ldots$, but rather $2, 3, 5, 7, 9,\\ldots $. To implement this change, define a procedure next that returns $3$ if its input is equal to $2$ and otherwise returns its input plus $2$. Modify the `smallest-divisor` procedure to use `(next test-divisor)` instead of `(+ test-divisor 1)`. With `timed-prime-test` incorporating this modified version of `smallest-divisor`, run the test for each of the 12 primes found in Exercise 1.22. Since this modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it to run about twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed? If not, what is the observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain the fact that it is different from $2$?**"

    "Our `expmod` procedure works by exploiting the fact that the $mod$ operation is multiplicative, that is, $ab\\mod n = (a\\mod n)(b\\mod n)\\mod n$. This lets us avoid having to work with very large numbers when computing $a^m\\mod n$, because we don't have to compute $a^m$ first. However, the procedure suggested by Alyssa P. Hacker is doing exactly that - it is computing $a^m$ first and calculating the remainder with $m$. The procedure produces the correct result, and the number of steps are more or less the same, but because operations with large numbers actually takes a non-constant number of steps internally, the suggested procedure would be slower with large numbers. That weakness will be particularly visible with our fast prime tester, because we are repeatedly applying the `expmod` operation with very large powers."

    "By replacing the `square` application with an explicit multiplication, Louis has ensured that `expmod` will be called two times in that part of the procedure. If he had left the `square` call, the evaluator would have evaluated the `expmod` call first and squared the resulting value. Writing it this way, the multiplication procedure has to evaluate its arguments, of which there are two - the two calls to `expmod`. In our original procedure, a $\\Theta(\\log{n})$ order of growth was achieved by halving the exponent in that step. Because the recursion terminates when the exponent is zero, and we can only halve the exponent $\\log_2{n}$ times, a logarithmic order of growth was achieved. But now we are halving the exponent but also doubling the number of calls, and those effects cancel each other out. The second `cond` case where `exp` is even does not affect the number of steps now, only the third case does, which subtracts 1 from `exp`. Therefore, the process now has $\\Theta(n)$ order of growth."

    "**One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the *Miller-Rabin test* (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980). This starts from an alternate form of Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem, which states that if $n$ is a prime number and $a$ is any positive integer less than $n$, then $a$ raised to the $(n-1)$-st power is congruent to 1 modulo $n$. To test the primality of a number $n$ by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a random number $a \\lt n$ and raise $a$ to the $(n-1)$-st power modulo $n$ using the `expmod` procedure. However, whenever we perform the squaring step in `expmod`, we check to see if we have discovered a \"nontrivial square root of 1 modulo $n$\", that is, a number not equal to 1 or $n-1$ whose square is equal to 1 modulo $n$. It is possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of 1 exists, then $n$ is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if $n$ is an odd number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers $a < n$, computing $a^{n-1}$ in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo $n$. (This is why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.) Modify the `expmod` procedure to signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of 1, and use this to implement the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to `fermat-test`. Check your procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. Hint: One convenient way to make `expmod` signal is to have it return 0.**"
