# SICP Solutions

These are my solutions to exercise in the book [Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/
index.html). (Here is a nice [pdf version](https://github.com/sarabander/
sicp-pdf)). I have written the solutions in jupyter notebooks running the
[Calysto Scheme](https://github.com/Calysto/calysto_scheme) kernel, one
notebook for each chapter.
