# SICP Solutions

These are my solutions to exercises in the book [Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).
(Here is a nice [pdf version](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf)).
The solutions are in the form of jupyter notebooks running the
[Calysto Scheme](https://github.com/Calysto/calysto_scheme) kernel, one
notebook for each chapter.
