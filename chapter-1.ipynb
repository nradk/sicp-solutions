For example, the square root of $0.00000004$  is $0.0002$. But if a guess is 0.0008, which is eight times the actual square root, it will be good enough for our test becuase the difference is $0.0008 - 0.0002 = 0.0006 \\lt 0.001 $\n",

When a number gets really large, even changing the least significant bit on by one changes the number by a large difference. As a result, limited precision floating point numbers cannot represent a lot of the intermediate values between large numbers that it can represent. So, for large enough numbers, our computations may never produce guesses that are within $1$ of the true square root, let alone $0.001$ of the square root."

Because the second term is less than $0.5$, the first term must be greater. Hence, the closest integer to the first term is also the value of $Fib(n)$. When the second term is positive, their non-integer parts subtract. To make the result an integer, they have to be equal.
