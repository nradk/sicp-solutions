    "I am fairly certian this is not possible. Here's why. When we talk about 'equivalent algebraic expressions', we need a strict definition for what counts as an algebraic operation and what counts as algebraic. With regular real numbers, these are defined by the field axioms and the theorems resulting from it, since the real numbers are a field. When we take algebraic expressions that are often used with real numbers and say two of them are equivalent, it can only be extended to other fields, and in general not other types of algebraic structures. For example, matrices and matrix multiplication don't form a field, so many algebraic expressions are not even defined for them, let alone \"equivalent\" expressions producing equivalent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question we must ask is, are intervals a field? I think they aren't. Some of the field axioms of interest are the existence of a multiplicative and additive identities and corresponding inverses. We can think of $[0, 0]$ as the additive identity and $[1,1]$ as the multiplicative one. The definition of the additive identity certainly fits with the definition of addition in the book. But the field axioms also state that each element that is not the additive identity must have a multiplicative inverse. Now, take $[a,b]$, whose \"inverse\" under our definition is $[1/b, 1/a]$. Multiplying them, we get $[a/b, b/a]$, which except in the special case of $a=b$ is not equal to our multiplicative identity.\n",
